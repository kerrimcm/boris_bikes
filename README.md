# Boris Bikes

Transport for London have come to us in order to create a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. This program emulates the behaviour of docking stations, bikes and infrastructure.

## Getting started

`git clone https://github.com/kerrimcm/boris_bikes.git`

## Running tests

`rspec` 

## Day 1 Progress

By the end of day one, my pair partner and I had written up User Stories to begin building out the basic functionality of the docking stations and the bike - see the document here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bTRJ9mylCGj5JJM_WS78D48dW9wGqcn-M96GF6QNrtU/edit?usp=sharing
