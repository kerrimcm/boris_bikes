# Boris Bikes

Transport for London have come to us in order to create a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. This program emulates the behaviour of docking stations, bikes and infrastructure.

## Getting started

`git clone https://github.com/kerrimcm/boris_bikes.git`

## Running tests

`rspec` 

## Day 1 Progress

By the end of day one, my pair partner and I had written up User Stories to begin building out the basic functionality of the docking stations and the bike - see the document here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bTRJ9mylCGj5JJM_WS78D48dW9wGqcn-M96GF6QNrtU/edit?usp=sharing

We then began testing code using smaller feature tests on `irb` to see if it was working as expected. 

## Day 2 Progress

By the end of day two, my pair partner and I made some progress adding and testing new features in the program. We clarified the cycle where you run feature tests in `irb`, you then write your tests in RSpec, you then try make those tests pass and once at the 'GREEN' phase of TDD, you refactor your code and start again trying out new features. Tried my best to let the errors guide my decision making. First attemt at `raise_error` and `fail` exceptions.
